RISS (Really Intuitive Social Syndication) is a proposed extension to [RSS][rss] to improve distribution of content with social context (e.g. likes, comments, shares, etc.). The idea is that anyone should be able to create, consume and interact with content on the internet without being confined to centralised, walled-off platforms.

## Why?

### Why is social content important?

Interacting to existing content is far easier than creating new content. This social aspect reduces the barrier to entry for content creation, and is a key part of success of social media platforms. It democratises content creation and encourages more active participation in the internet.

### Why is it important to decentralise?

Fragmantation is terrible for the internet in general:
-  I will miss out on content and creators that I would like unless I actively check multiple platforms.
-  Discussion on a topic in one platform is disconnected from the same discussion on another, impeding circulation of ideas and thoughts.

People don't own their own content:
- I can't take my content, my likes, comments, followers, etc. and move to another platform if the changes to one platform aren't to my liking.
- Platforms should not have a right to moderate what I say or whether people who are interested in hearing that get to hear that. They should, however get the right to moderate what they propagate and distribute. This separation is not possible when content creation and propagation are intertwined in the same platform.

### Why isn't the Fediverse good enough?

[The fediverse][fediverse] requires me to distribute my content (or some "node" or "server" to do that on my behalf), which increases the cost of participation, lowering to a less decentralised (well, intentionally "federated" situation). This is analogous to EMail services, where the federated design led to a few large providers dominating and controlling the market.
